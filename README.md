Our project at the Open University of Sri Lanka aims to develop a communication platform akin to Slack, facilitating discussion groups for students and communication between students and academic staff. Through channels, direct messaging, and group chats, users can engage in academic discussions, seek guidance, and share resources. 
Our goal is to create an inclusive and interactive environment that fosters learning, knowledge exchange, and academic support within the university community.
